# Learning ReactJs

There are 2 beginner modules.

Module 1 - create react app
npx create-react-app my-app

This creates a full directory with node modules imported, a github repo initiated, and your regular JS development directories (src, public) setting you up for a single page react webpage. This allows you to get easily up and running with react development. You simply

cd my-app
npm start

and you see the react webpage up and running. However it comes with a lot more dependencies than you might need, especially as a beginner. The my-app directory file size is 162.7mb.

Module 2 - webpack setup
This takes a longer approached for getting someone up and running, but gives you a better understanding of the node module structure and the development environment that supports react such as live reloading, tree shaking, lazy loading, and so much more.

This tutorial[https://www.sitepoint.com/beginners-guide-webpack-module-bundling/] by Mark Brown is a great resource for setting this up and getting an overview of how each node module functions together to setup the development environment. You have a lot less dependencies installed and your directory is 64.1mb.

Both modules give you small builds for delivery so there is no need to worry on that end.
